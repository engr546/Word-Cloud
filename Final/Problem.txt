Things to remember:
-remove all the punctuation marks.
	go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the isalpha() method
-To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.
-check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting" set of words. (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if")
	Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if necessary.
